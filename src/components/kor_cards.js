              text='Recipe: Heat the olive oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter in the large skillet.
              Once the butter has melted, add the shallots and garlic. Sauté on medium-low heat until the shallots are translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the Arborio rice and toss to coat in the oil and butter. Sauté until the rice is very lightly browned.Add a ladleful of the hot stock and stir until the stock is absorbed. Repeat, adding a ladle or two of stock at a time, until the rice is al dente, and you have used most of (or all of) the stock. This will take about 20 minutes. The rice will be creamy.Turn off the heat and top with another ladleful of stock, the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, and the Parmesan cheese. Stir to combine and cover with a lid.
              Heat the shrimp sauce until simmering. Toss the shrimp into the sauce to warm them back up. Ladle the risotto into warm bowls and top with an equal amount of shrimp and sauce. Top with more Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley.'

              METHOD-
              Arrange the sausages and mozzarella cheese sticks onto skewers. You can make mozzarella corn dogs by just using the cheese and not the sausage.

              In a bowl, mix together your dry ingredients and slowly incorporate the milk and egg. If your batter seems too thick, add more milk in 20 ml increments. You want a thick and sticky consistency. The batter should stick to the skewers and not drip off easily. Place the mixture in a glass. 
              
              Dip your skewers into the glass of thick batter.

              Remove the excess and roll in the panko breadcrumbs or chopped fries. A mixture between the two will also work well. Press the breadcrumbs and or chopped fries gently to help the coating stay on the skewers.

              Deep fry these at 160-170 degrees for 3-5 minutes. Only fry 2-3 skewers at one time to make sure the temperature of the oil stays consistent.

              text='Recipe: Mound flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat eggs, water, and olive oil in a bowl. Pour 1/2 of the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing egg and flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.

              Knead dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
              
              While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling: Mix ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley until well combined. Set the filling aside.
              
              Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Stir in heavy cream; increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Whisk in Parmesan cheese until melted. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.
              
              Meanwhile, warm marinara sauce over medium-low heat in a separate saucepan.
              
              Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat egg and 1 tablespoon of water together in a small bowl to make the egg wash.
              
              Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop cheese filling in 1-teaspoon portions onto the dough, 1-inch apart.
              
              Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta; use your fingers to press around each portion of filling, making the seal as airtight as possible. Cut out individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Use your fingers to seal the edges.
              
              Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.
              
              Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.
              
              To serve, divide ravioli between four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle marinara sauce on top, followed by cream sauce.'
