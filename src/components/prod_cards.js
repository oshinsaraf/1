              Once the butter has melted, add the shallots and garlic. Sauté on medium-low heat until the shallots are translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the Arborio rice and toss to coat in the oil and butter. Sauté until the rice is very lightly browned.Add a ladleful of the hot stock and stir until the stock is absorbed. Repeat, adding a ladle or two of stock at a time, until the rice is al dente, and you have used most of (or all of) the stock. This will take about 20 minutes. The rice will be creamy.Turn off the heat and top with another ladleful of stock, the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, and the Parmesan cheese. Stir to combine and cover with a lid.
              Heat the shrimp sauce until simmering. Toss the shrimp into the sauce to warm them back up. Ladle the risotto into warm bowls and top with an equal amount of shrimp and sauce. Top with more Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley.'

Dust the space a little using dry flour and take a large amount of the pizza dough. Using a rolling pin, roll this dough into a nice circular base. (Note: Make sure that the circular base is even at all ends.) Once you have made the base, use a fork and prick the base with it so that the base doesnt rise and gets baked nicely.

              text='Recipe: MAKE SAUCE
              Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.
              
              Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.
              
              Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.
              
              Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly (see notes for suggestions).
              
              COOK SPAGHETTI
              About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, and then cook pasta according to package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time.
              
              TO FINISH
              Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta, and then leave for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with parmesan sprinkled on top.'

              Preheat oven to 350°F
              Prepare the garlic bread:
              Cut the loaf in half, horizontally. Mix the butter, garlic, and parsley together in a small bowl. Spread butter mixture over the the two bread halves.Heat in oven for 10 min:
              Place on a sturdy baking pan (one that can handle high temperatures, not a cookie sheet) and heat in a 350°F (175°C) oven for 10 minutes.
              
              Sprinkle with Parmesan (optional) and broil:
              Remove pan from oven. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over bread if you want. Return to oven on the highest rack.
              
              Broil on high heat for 2-3 minutes until the edges of the bread begin to toast and the cheese (if you are using cheese) bubbles. Watch very carefully while broiling. The bread can easily go from un-toasted to burnt.
              
              Slice:
              Remove from oven, let cool a minute. Remove from pan and use a bread knife to cut into 1-inch thick slices. Serve immediately.'

              text='Recipe: Mound flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat eggs, water, and olive oil in a bowl. Pour 1/2 of the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing egg and flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.

              Knead dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
              
              While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling: Mix ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley until well combined. Set the filling aside.
              
              Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Stir in heavy cream; increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Whisk in Parmesan cheese until melted. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.
              
              Meanwhile, warm marinara sauce over medium-low heat in a separate saucepan.
              
              Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat egg and 1 tablespoon of water together in a small bowl to make the egg wash.
              
              Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop cheese filling in 1-teaspoon portions onto the dough, 1-inch apart.
              
              Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta; use your fingers to press around each portion of filling, making the seal as airtight as possible. Cut out individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Use your fingers to seal the edges.
              
              Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.
              
              Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.
              
              To serve, divide ravioli between four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle marinara sauce on top, followed by cream sauce.'
